# Node.js

Node (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). As such, the environment omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries.


## 서버 개발에 있어서 노드의 장점

Great performance! Node has been designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a very good match for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).
Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context shift" between languages when you're writing both browser and web server code.
JavaScript is a relatively new programming language and benefits from improvements in language design when compared to other traditional web-server languages (e.g. Python, PHP, etc.) Many other new and popular languages compile/convert into JavaScript so you can also use CoffeeScript, ClosureScript, Scala, LiveScript, etc.
The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages. It also has best-in-class dependency resolution and can also be used to automate most of the build toolchain.
It is portable, with versions running on Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, WebOS, and NonStop OS. Furthermore, it is well-supported by many web hosting providers, that often provide specific infrastructure and documentation for hosting Node sites.
It has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community, with lots of people who are willing to help.
